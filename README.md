**Smart Logistics & Delivery Tracking System** ðŸš€

**Overview**
The Smart Logistics & Delivery Tracking System is a full-stack application that provides real-time shipment tracking, AI-powered delay predictions, and route optimization to enhance logistics efficiency. This project integrates machine learning, cloud computing, and modern DevOps practices, making it a cutting-edge solution for supply chain management.

**Features**
âœ… Real-Time Shipment Tracking â€“ Monitor deliveries and status updates via an interactive dashboard.
âœ… AI-Powered Delay Prediction â€“ Uses machine learning to predict delays based on historical and live data.
âœ… Route Optimization â€“ Suggests optimal delivery routes using AI.
âœ… Microservices Architecture â€“ Backend services built using Spring Boot & Java for scalability.
âœ… SQL Database Integration â€“ Stores shipment and tracking details securely.
âœ… Cloud Deployment â€“ Hosted on AWS (EC2, RDS, S3) for high availability.
âœ… CI/CD Pipeline â€“ Automates builds and deployments using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes.

This project predicts **shipment delays** using a **hybrid machine learning model** with:
- âœ… **XGBoost** (structured tabular data)
- âœ… **LSTM Neural Networks** (time-series learning)
- âœ… **TensorBoard** for real-time training visualization

ðŸ“Œ Running XGBoost on Different Systems
XGBoost requires OpenMP for optimized parallel processing.
Depending on your operating system, you may need extra steps to install OpenMP.
âœ… MacOS (Apple Silicon & Intel)
Run the following command:
brew install libomp

ðŸ“Œ If XGBoost still fails with an OpenMP error, try setting the environment variable manually:
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp/bin:$PATH"
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp/include"

ðŸ“Œ Then, reinstall XGBoost:
pip uninstall xgboost -y
pip install xgboost
